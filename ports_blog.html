                            <p>The Spinnaker Tower is a 170-metre (560 ft) landmark observation tower in Portsmouth, England.
                            It is the centrepiece of the redevelopment of Portsmouth Harbour, which was supported by a National Lottery grant.
                            The tower's design was chosen by Portsmouth residents from a selection of three different designs in a 1998 public poll.
                            It has three viewing platforms one on top of the other at heights of 100 m, 105 m and 110 m.

                            <p> Gunwharf Quays is a shopping centre located in the Portsea area of the city of Portsmouth in England. 
                                It was constructed in the early 21st century on the site of what had once been HM Gunwharf, Portsmouth. 
                                This was one of several such facilities which were established around Britain and the Empire by the Board of Ordnance, where cannons, ammunition and other armaments were stored, repaired and serviced ready for use on land or at sea. 
                                Later known as HMS Vernon, the military site closed in 1995, and opened to the public as Gunwharf Quays on 28 February 2001

                                HMS Warrior is a marvel of Victorian engineering and an icon of British naval power. 
                                Launched in 1860, the steam-powered HMS Warrior was once the pride of Queen Victoria's fleet, and today stands as the world's first iron-hulled warship. 
                                HMS Warrior now sits pride of place in Portsmouth Harbour, an iconic figure of the Solent waterfront.
